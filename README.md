# Urban Office Information Infrastructure Solution

## Overview

This document outlines the immediate solution proposed for the information infrastructure of an urban office. 
The office comprises four floors, each with distinct requirements and constraints.

## Floor-wise Requirements

### Top Floor (Research Wing)
- **Machines:** Support 100 machines for the company's research wing.
- **Wireless Communication:** Capacity to provide wireless communication for 50 mobile nodes concurrently.

### Third Floor
- **Wired Communication:** Provide wired communication for 60 basic workplace machines.
- **Secure Wireless Access:** CEO's and CTO's offices, situated on the third floor, require secure wireless access.

### Second Floor
- **Server Room:** House FTP, Mail, and Web Servers.
- **Corporate Firewall System:** Provide edge security for internet access and connectivity to branch offices.

### First Floor (Area 01)
- **Customer Handling Nodes:** Accommodate 20 machines for customer handling.

## Additional Considerations

- **Branch Offices:** Two branch offices need to be connected to the main building.
  Branch offices are already equipped with a fully networked environment, featuring a firewall/router at their edges.
